# ControlAlgorithms
A collection of control algorithms in CPP designed for running on MCUs. Currently tested on an ESP32. Should work on most architectures
 using the Arduino Toolchain.


Currently Proportional, Integral, and Derivative controllers are implemented independently.
Enables easy combination for various control types. Includes stateless and stateful versions of each.
